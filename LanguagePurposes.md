# Language Purpose

- Why was the Language created?
- What problems was the language trying to address?
- Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?

# Java

- Java was created in 1995 by James Gosling while working at Sun Microsystems. His idea for the language to allow developers to only write code once and work on all systems. The way this was possible was by creating the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java compiles into bytecode that is then interpreted by the JVM that allows the code to be read on any machine.

# Swift

- Swift was created by Apple in 2014 and was designed to essentially replace Objective-C, which was what Apple used to create a vast majority of it's apps. It is built to run on the Open Source LLVM compiler and uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows C, Objective-C, C++, and Swift to run within the same program.
