# Java and Swift
- Java and Swift support both functional and procedural programming. Although Java is an object oriented language at heart, it's classes can be written in a way that allows for the class to be handled more procedurally. Swift prides itself on the fact that it does not conform to one type of programming procedure. It gives you the power to handle things either object oriented, procedurally, functionally, or any other way.
